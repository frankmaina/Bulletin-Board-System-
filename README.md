# Bulletin-Board-System

This is a a simple bulletin board system i made while in university as a small project to demonstrate distributed computing. The requirement was only that something should compile and run by the end of the semester so I never had the chance to do alot with it. 

It runs on both <b> Netbeans 7 and 8,</b> I did not test it on eclipse.

Known issues 
1. The client gives a <i><u>Network Unreachable Error</i></u>  when you try to start it without stating the server first.
2. Formating on the anouncement.dat file is not that good
