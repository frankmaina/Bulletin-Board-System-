Bulletin-Board-System-
==================
This is a a simple bulletin board system i made while in university as a small project to demonstrate distributed computing.
The requirement was only that something should compile and run by the end of the semester so i never had the chance to do alot with it.
It runs on both netbeans 7 and 8, i did not test it on eclipse.

Known issues
1. the client gives a network unreachable error when you try to start it without stating the server first.
2. formating on the anouncement.dat file is not that good
